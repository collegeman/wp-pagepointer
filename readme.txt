This plugin allows you to post into your blog's taxnomy a reference to any page on the web, including other pages or posts on your own site.
The benefit here is that you can create a library of off-site content, sorted into your personal categories and/or tags (or any other 
custom taxonomy applied to posts). Visitors to your post will be redirected (301) to the page you reference.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to post into your blog's taxnomy a reference to any page on the web, including other pages or posts on your own site.
The benefit here is that you can create a library of off-site content, sorted into your personal categories and/or tags (or any other 
custom taxonomy applied to posts). Visitors to your post will be redirected (301) to the page you reference.

For each "page pointer" post, you can specify the title, write an excerpt, and even set a featured image. If your target page has Open
Graph meta data (doesn't everybody?), then you can even tell your post to use their image as your featured image. The image is downloaded,
resized, and stored in your own blog.

== Installation ==

1. Install this plugin.
2. Start a new post.
3. Identify the "Redirect To" meta toolbox (http://cl.ly/1y2T3N3P2U1T273S271i)
4. Enter a URL. The plugin will go out and get information about your target page.
5. Optionally, tell the plugin you want to use the image it finds on your target page as the featured image for your post.
6. Publish or Schedule the post, just like any other post you would write.
